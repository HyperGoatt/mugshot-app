{ "screenName": "Onboarding - Bio and Location", "issueAnalysis": { "headerPosition": { "observed": "The header text 'Tell us about yourself' is positioned too high and is partially cut off by the device's dynamic island / status bar area.", "rootCause": "Likely missing SafeArea padding or incorrect VStack alignment. Possibly using .ignoresSafeArea() or negative spacers.", "expectedFix": "Apply .padding(.top, safeAreaInsets.top + X) OR wrap the entire scroll content in a VStack aligned below the safe area. Remove any .offset that pushes content upward." },

"bioFieldSize": {
  "observed": "The multiline text editor for the Bio field is extremely tall, taking up ~70% of the screen height.",
  "impact": "Feels unbalanced, dominates layout, causes next button to float in awkward center position.",
  "rootCause": "Fixed-height or flexible Frame(maxHeight: .infinity) applied. Possibly using geometry reader or unconstrained VStack.",
  "expectedFix": "Set a controlled height, e.g. 120–160px max. Include character limit (e.g. 200–250 chars). Add placeholder styling."
},


"nextButton": {
  "observed": "The circular next-button is centered vertically inside the oversized Bio field rather than below the field.",
  "rootCause": "Button likely placed inside same container as the TextEditor, possibly using ZStack overlay incorrectly.",
  "expectedFix": "Move button OUTSIDE the bio field container. Place below with proper spacing from design system tokens."
},


"cityField": {
  "observed": "City/Location field is too close to the bottom black home indicator. Not enough bottom padding.",
  "expectedFix": "Add bottom padding equal to safeAreaInsets.bottom + designSystem.spacing.large."
},


"colorsAndDesignTokens": {
  "observed": "Background uses a blue tint (likely fallback) instead of Mugshot's true onboarding background token.",
  "expectedFix": "Replace raw Color with design-system color: onboardingBackground or surfaceSecondary."
},


"typography": {
  "observed": "Title uses full-size H1 near the device top, causing cutoff and imbalance.",
  "expectedFix": "Use a consistent onboarding title style (e.g. screenTitle / headlineBold). Add predictable spacing: 24–32pts below header before subtitle."
}
